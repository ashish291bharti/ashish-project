   Nepotism is a type of corruption but it happens for the simple reason that humans are social and emotional beings. 
   It is prevalent because a person gives more importance to kinship than to loyalty.
   Nepotism particularly prevails in countries or organizations where strict rules and regulations to deal with it aren’t imposed.
